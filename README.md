# PersonalityDiscrimination_Chatting
Personality Representation &amp; Personality based Chatting   

This is a project of the "三个咕咕呆写出了一群bug"(Three heros & A bunch of bug) in Google AI ML Winter Camp. Thanks to my team members!  

[MBTI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) Personality can be judged by one's declaration, social media posts, or dialogue.  This personality can be used in chatting machine. If chatting machine can to learn the speaker's personality, they might be able to make better dialogues.    
According to this idea, we make a simple chatting machine. Our model is simple and the data is few, so the result is not very good, but the idea of chatting machine with personality analysis may be worthwhile.

## Method 

This work mainly consists of two parts, 1. Personality Discriminator: discriminate the speaker's personality according to some input sentences. 2. Chatting Machine: Ggenerate the corresponding respose according to the input sentence and the speaker's personality.

1. Personality Discriminator:

Target of this part is classifying people into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis, showing their somedialogues or some declaration (or Twitter, Wechat …)  ([kaggle MBTI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type))

We used ELMo pretrained model, Bi-LSTM encoder and self Attention Mechanisms.

2. Chatting Machine:

Given a post X= (x_1,x_2,..,x_n ) and a personality type e of the response
to be generated, the goal is to generate a response Y= (y_1,y_2,..,y_n )
that is coherent with the personality type e.

### About Code
MBTI_discriminator_torch.py ,  MBTI_discriminator_bert.py , MBTI_discriminator_lgb.ipynb       
All three files are MBTI discrimination model. The first file contains the main model.  
dialogue.py     
seq2seq conversation model   
front    
This folder contains the front-end program for chatting machine.    

## Results

The model outputs both personality scores and dialogue response.
